AI-Generated Code (sort_list.py)
python
from typing import Any, Callable, Iterable, List, Mapping, Optional, Sequence, Union, Tuple

def sort_dicts(items: Iterable[Mapping[str, Any]], key: Union[str, Callable], 
               reverse: bool = False, missing: str = "last") -> List[Mapping[str, Any]]:
    # Complex implementation with nested key support, 
    # missing value handling, and custom sort logic
    # (70+ lines of code)


Manual Implementation (sort_list_dictionaries.py)
python
def dict_sort_list(dict_list, sort_key):
    return sorted(dict_list, key=lambda x: x[sort_key])

Clean, simple manual implementation

Key Findings
Manual Code is More Efficient
Performance Advantage:

Direct use of Python's optimized sorted() function (runs at C speed)

Minimal function call overhead

No unnecessary type checking or validation

Simplicity Wins:

3 lines vs 70+ lines

Easy to read, debug, and maintain

Perfectly solves the assigned task without over-engineering

Memory Efficiency:

No temporary lists or tuples created

Minimal memory footprint

Straightforward data processing

When to Use AI Code
The AI-generated solution would be beneficial only if you need:

Nested key support ("address.city")

Missing value handling

Custom key functions

Advanced error handling

Conclusion
For the specific task of sorting dictionaries by a key, the manual implementation is significantly more efficient. The AI solution, while impressive in its feature set, represents classic over-engineering for simple tasks.

Recommendation: Use manual implementation for straightforward sorting tasks and reserve AI-generated complex solutions for when advanced features are actually required.
